About:

This project was made to analyze the difference in time and the code itself between a python script and a bash script, iterating the requests over a 1001 domain list took on avarage 24 minutes in the python version, while the bash required 9 and a half minutes on avarage

Description:

A simple Python script that performs HTTP requests to retrieve either the HTML status code or the full HTML content from a list of domains stored in a .txt file. It also measures the total execution time.
Additionally, a Bash script is included to perform the same operation using curl instead of the Python requests library.

ðŸ“Œ Features

- Reads domains from a file called domains_list.txt
- Performs HTTP requests using the requests library (Python) or curl(Bash)
- Handles exceptions to manage connection and SSL errors
- Defines a timeout for requests to avoid being stuck on slow domains.
- Measures total execution time of the script.
